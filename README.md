# Vanier College Integrative Project in Computer Science

This capstone project integrates physics concepts to create a learning tool comprised of 2 simulations: A Newton's 2nd law simulator, and a standing waves simulator. It is the culmination of 2 years spent at Vanier College.

This project was done using **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **CSS**. 

A grade of **100%** was achieved on this project.

## My responsiblities for this project included:
- Designing the overall layout of the application and all windows displayed to the user
- Implementing all mathematical formulae and concepts into the 2 simulations
- Leading a team of 4 to create 2 whole physics simulations
- Helping teammates debug their code and aiding them when getting stuck
